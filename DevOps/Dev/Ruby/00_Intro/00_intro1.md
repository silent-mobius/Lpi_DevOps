In this class, my aim to guide you safely guide you through the deep waters of 
Ruby’s syntax and  libraries. In the process, I’ll be exploring both the,
highs and lows  of Ruby. By the end of the class, you should be able to
use Ruby safely and effectively without getting caught by unexpected hazards
along the way.
