camelCaseStyle and under_score_style. Many argue about what is the right style
and how it should be use. As for me, due to some background that i have with Python
I'd prefer to use under_score_style, but if you are used or charmed by some other
styling, you are welcome to use. As log as you code is easy to understand and read
code styling does not matter(from my point of view at least)
