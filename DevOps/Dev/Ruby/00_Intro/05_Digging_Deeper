Every chapter, apart from the first one, includes a section called “Digging
Deeper.” This is where you will explore specific aspects of Ruby in greater depth. In
many cases, you could skip the “Digging Deeper” sections and still learn all
the Ruby you will ever need. On the other hand, it is in these sections that you
will often get closest to the inner workings of Ruby, so if you skip them, you'll still learn Ruby
but, if you go through them it will add to your knowledge of Ruby internals.
