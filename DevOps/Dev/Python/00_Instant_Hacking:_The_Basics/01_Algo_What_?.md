Before we start programming in earnest, I’ll try to give you an idea of what computer programming is. Simply
put, it’s telling a computer what to do. Computers can do a lot of things, but they aren’t very good at thinking

a fancy word for a detailed description of how to do something.
Recipes and algorithms consist of ingredients (objects, things) and instructions (statements). Let’s start with some 
reasonably simple Python ingredients and see what you can do with them.
