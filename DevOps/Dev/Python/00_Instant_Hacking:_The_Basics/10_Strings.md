It is customary to begin with a program like this in programming tutorials. The problem is that I haven’t
really explained how it works yet. You know the basics of the print statement but what is "Hello, world!"?
It’s called a string (as in “a string of characters”). Strings are foundin almost every useful,
real-world Python program and have many uses. Their main use is to represent bits of text, such as the exclamation “Hello, world!"
