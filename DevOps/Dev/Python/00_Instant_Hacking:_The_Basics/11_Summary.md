Algorithms: An algorithm is a recipe telling you exactly how to perform a task.
When you program a computer, you are essentially describing an algorithm in
a language the computer can understand, such as Python. Such a machine-
friendly description is called a program, and it mainly consists of expressions and
statements.
Expressions: An expression is a part of a computer program that represents
a value. For example, 2 + 2 is an expression, representing the value 4. Simple
expressions are built from literal values (such as 2 or "Hello") by using operators
(such as + or %) and functions (such as pow). More complicated expressions
can be created by combining simpler expressions (e.g., (2 + 2) * (3 - 1)).
Expressions may also contain variables.
Variables: A variable is a name that represents a value. New values may be assigned
to variables through assignments such as x = 2. An assignment is a kind of statement.
Statements: A statement is an instruction that tells the computer to do
something. That may involve changing variables (through assignments), printing
things to the screen (such as print("Hello, world!")), importing modules, or
doing a host of other stuff.
Functions: Functions in Python work just like functions in mathematics: they
may take some arguments, and they return a result.
Modules: Modules are extensions that can be imported into Python to extend its
capabilities.
Programs: You have looked at the practicalities of writing, saving, and running
Python programs.
Strings: Strings are really simpleâ€”they are just pieces of text, with characters
represented as Unicode code points. And yet there is a lot to know about them.
