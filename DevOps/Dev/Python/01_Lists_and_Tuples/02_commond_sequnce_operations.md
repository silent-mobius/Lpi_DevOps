Indexing: All elements in a sequence are numberedâ€”from zero and upward. You can access them individually with a number

Slicing:  you can use slicing to access ranges of elements. You do this by using two indices, separated by a colon.

Adding Sequences: Sequences can be concatenated with the addition (plus) operator.

Multiplication: Multiplying a sequence by a number x creates a new sequence where the original sequence is repeated x times:

Membership: To check whether a value can be found in a sequence, you use the 'in' operator. This operator is a bit different
from the ones discussed up until now. It checks whether something is true and returns a value accordingly: True for true 
and False for false. Such operators are called Boolean operators,and the truth values are called Boolean values. 

Length, Minimum, and Maximum: The built-in functions len, min, and max can be quite useful. The function len returns the number of elements
a sequence contains. min and max return the smallest and largest elements of the sequence, respectively.
