You’ve seen how useful they are, but this section deals with what makes them different 
from tuples and strings: lists are mutable—that is, you can change their contents—and 
they have many useful specialized methods.

Basic List Operations: You can perform all the standard sequence operations on lists, such as indexing, slicing, concatenating,
and multiplying. But the interesting thing about lists is that they can be modified.

Changing Lists: Item Assignments :Regular assignment usually looks like this: x = 2. Instead of writing something like that, you use the indexing notation to assign
to a specific, existing position, such as x[1] = 2. 1 represent the place in list.(they start from 0)

Changing Lists: Deleting Elements: Deleting elements from a list is easy, too. You can simply use the 'del' statement.
