#working with libs

1. 
When working on OS, you are required to get all possible info regarding the os you are working on. by using libraries os, sys, netifaces,ipaddress, platform, subprocess. please provide data about:
	*interface
	*network shares
	*users
	*storage
	*filesystem
	*system variables
	*python version
	*kernel version
	
2.
As part system application automation, you are required to install and configure nosql library called tinyDB.
the steps of linrady install, deploy and confifuration are:
	* install tinydb python library.
	* import tinydb  library and creaty basic json file to store data in it.
	* validate that json file is query is empty.
Create an automated python script that will do all steps above and will use all possible libraries: os,sys,time,json
tinydb,subprocess,string.

3.
as part of network automation, your task is to install, manage and deploy servers by using paramiko library.
