#python loops
1.
	A.Print i as long as i is less than 6.
	B.Stop the loop if i is 3.
	C.Loop through the items in the fruits list.
	D.In the loop, when the item value is "banana", jump directly to the next item.
	E.Use the range function to loop through a code set 6 times.

In this exercise you will create a program that computes the average of a collection
of values entered by the user. The user will enter 0 as a sentinel value to indicate
that no further values will be provided. Your program should display an appropriate
error message if the first value entered by the user is 0.
Hint: Because the 0 marks the end of the input it should not be included in the
average.

3.
Write a program that displays a temperature conversion table for degrees Celsius and
degrees Fahrenheit. The table should include rows for all temperatures between 0
and 100 degrees Celsius that are multiples of 10 degrees Celsius. Include appropriate
headings on your columns. The formula for converting between degrees Celsius and
degrees Fahrenheit can be found on the internet.

One of the first known examples of encryption was used by Julius Caesar. Caesar needed to provide written
instructions to his generals, but he didn’t want his enemies to learn his plans if the message slipped into their hands.
As result, he developed what later became known as the Caesar Cipher.
The idea behind this cipher is simple (and as a result, it provides no protection against modern code breaking techniques).
Each letter in the original message is shifted by 3 places. As a result, A becomes D, B becomes E, C becomes F, D
becomes G, etc. The last three letters in the alphabet are wrapped around to the beginning: X becomes A,
Y becomes B and Z becomes C. Non-letter characters are not modified by the cipher.
 
 Write a program that implements a Caesar cipher. Allow the user to supply the
 message and the shift amount, and then display the shifted message. Ensure that
 your program encodes both uppercase and lowercase letters. Your program should
 also support negative shift values so that it can be used both to encode messages and
 decode messages.

5.
A string is a palindrome if it is identical forward and backward. For example “anna”,
“civic”, “level” and “hannah” are all examples of palindromic words. Write a program
that reads a string from the user and uses a loop to determines whether or not it is a
palindrome. Display the result, including a meaningful output message.

6.
There are numerous phrases that are palindromes when spacing is ignored. Examples
include “go dog”, “flee to me remote elf” and “some men interpret nine memos”,
among many others. Extend your solution to Exercise 72 so that it ignores spacing
while determining whether or not a string is a palindrome. For an additional challenge,
extend your solution so that is also ignores punctuation marks and treats uppercase
and lowercase letters as equivalent.
