#python functions
1.
	A.Create a function named my_function that prints hello from function.
	B.Call (execute) a function named my_function.
	C.Inside a function with two parameters, print the first parameter.
	D.Let the function return the x parameter + 5.

Amazon retailer provides express shipping for many of its items at a rate of $12.65
for the first item, and $1.15 for each subsequent item. Write a function that takes the
number of items in the order as its only parameter. Return the shipping charge for
the order as the function’s result. Include a main program that reads the number of
items purchased from the user and displays the shipping charge.	

3.
If you have 3 straws, possibly of differing lengths, it may or may not be possible
to lay them down so that they form a triangle when their ends are touching. For
example, if all of the straws have a length of 6 inches. then one can easily construct
an equilateral triangle using them. However, if one straw is 6 inches. long, while the
other two are each only 2 inches. long, then a triangle cannot be formed. In general,
if any one length is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two then the lengths
cannot be used to form a triangle. Otherwise they can form a triangle.
Write a function that determines whether or not three lengths can form a triangle.
The function will take 3 parameters and return a Boolean result. In addition, write a
program that reads 3 lengths from the user and demonstrates the behaviour of this
function.

4.
A prime number is an integer greater than 1 that is only divisible by one and itself.
Write a function that determines whether or not its parameter is prime, returning
True if it is, and False otherwise. Write a main program that reads an integer
from the user and displays a message indicating whether or not it is prime. Ensure
that the main program will not run if the file containing your solution is imported
into another program.

5.
Write a function that generates a random password. The password should have a
random length of between 7 and 10 characters. Each character should be randomly
selected from positions 33 to 126 in the ASCII table. Your function will not take
any parameters. It will return the randomly generated password as its only result.
Display the randomly generated password in your file’s main program. Your main
program should only run when your solution has not been imported into another file.
