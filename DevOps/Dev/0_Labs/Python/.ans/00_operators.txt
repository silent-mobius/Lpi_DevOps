operators:
1.
	A.Create a script that usesq variables x and y.Multiply 10 with 5 using x and y, and print the result.
	B.In the same script,using divide 10 by 2, and print the result.
	C.Create a list if fruits.(apple,banana,melon,orange)Use the correct membership operator to check if "apple" is present in the fruits object.
	D.Create a condition check.Use the correct comparison operator to check if 5 is not equal to 10.
	E.Create a condition check.Use the correct logical operator to check if at least one of two statements is True.

2.
Create a program that reads two integers, a and b, from the user. Your program should compute and display:
	The sum of a and b
	The difference when b is subtracted from a
	The product of a and b6
	The quotient when a is divided by b
	The remainder when a is divided by b
	The result of a^b
