1. Modify the isort and asearch functions to use sort and grep, respectively, if the
array exceeds a certain size.
2. Write a function that transposes rows and columns in a grid (either a
single-string grid or an array). For example, transform these:
123
456
789
into these:
147
256
369
3. Convert some of the grid functions, either string or array versions, to work with
grids that are not square, for example, 6 Ã— 3.
4. Convert the code that parses fixed-width records into a function that accepts the
line of data as the first argument, followed by the varname=width list.
