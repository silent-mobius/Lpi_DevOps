1.
By default, where can a variable assigned in a script be accessed? Select all that apply:
• In the current script
• In functions defined in the current script
• In the script that called the current script
• In scripts called by the current script
• In subshells of the current script
2. I advise against using single-letter variables names but give a couple of places
where they are reasonable. Can you think of any other legitimate uses for them?
3. Given var=192.168.0.123 , write a script that uses parameter expansion to extract
the second number, 168 .
