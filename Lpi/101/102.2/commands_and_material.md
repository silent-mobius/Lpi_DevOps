*In this lecture, we review legacy GRUB, the method with which older Linux systems would boot. We break down the various stages of the GRUB boot process, look at an example GRUB configuration file, and get our first look at the GRUB shell.

*This lecture focuses on the next generation of GRUB, the GRUB2 boot loader. We will also look at how UEFI systems work, and why they offer more features over the old MBR systems. We see an example of modifying a GRUB2 file, and how to regenerate a new binary from it.

*In this lecture, we work with the GRUB boot menu in both legacy GRUB and GRUB2. We will practice booting the system using different kernel boot options, and learn how to reinstall GRUB to our disk. We even do a manual walkthrough of booting our computer using one GRUB command at a time.
NOTE: You will not be able to follow along with this lecture using the clous servers. You will need a locally installed virtual machine, as you will not have access to any boot menues from the cloud servers.
