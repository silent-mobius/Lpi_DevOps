*  This lecture discusses the main file system locations that the LPIC-1 candidate needs to understand: /, /var, /home, and /opt. We will demonstrate the mount, fdisk, lsblk, and swapon commands to view mounted locations, and we will begin our discussions on partitions.

* Here we will take a quick look at the basics of LVM. You will not need to know all of the ins and outs of LVM for the LPIC-1 exam, but you will need some basic familiarity with it. We will show you the structure of an LVM layout, along with some commands that will let you scan a system with LVM to see its structure
