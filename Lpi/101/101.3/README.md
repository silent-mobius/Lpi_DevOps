*Learn how to change the working environment of your system via System V Init runlevels. Even though this technology is not used as much anymore, the LPIC-1 candidate must know how to perform these tasks using commands such as runlevel, telinit, and init.

*The LPIC-1 candidate must know how to change a system's target for different operating environments. This lesson covers how this is done using systemd by using the systemctl command.

*This lesson shows you the various commands that can be used to shut down and power off your Linux computer. An LPIC-1 candidate will need to know how to use the poweroff, reboot, shutdown, and systemctl isolate commands to restart or bring a computer down from the command line. We also briefly introduce ACPI, which the LPIC-1 candidate needs to be awareness of.
